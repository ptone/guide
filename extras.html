    Let's try an experiment in two parts.
    First,
    run this program and look at the image files it creates:
  </p>

<pre>
from skimage import novice

BASE    = 128
STEP    = 4
SPACING = 4
NUMBER  = 6
GRAY    = (BASE, BASE, BASE)
SIZE    = 200

for color in range(BASE + STEP, BASE + NUMBER * STEP, STEP):
    image = novice.new((SIZE, SIZE), GRAY)
    image[::SPACING, ::SPACING] = (color, color, color)
    filename = 'step-' + str(color) + '.png'
    image.save(filename)
</pre>

  <p>
    These files have named like <code>step-132.png</code>,
    <code>step-136.png</code>,
    and so on.
    Each one has white pixels spaced evenly across a gray background,
    with the white slowly getting whiter.
    Images like these are sometimes used in vision tests,
    since different spacings and colorings are noticeable to different people.
  </p>

  <p>
    Having told you that,
    we've spoiled the second part of our experiment,
    which is to see how much knowing what a program does
    helps you figure out how it works.
    As you might suspect,
    the answer is, "A lot."
    Let's go through this one.
  </p>

  <p>
    The constants at the top don't tell us much,
    although <code>GRAY</code> is obviously an RGB color value
    and <code>SIZE</code> is (probably) an image size.
    Next is our loop:
    given the name of its index variable,
    <code>color</code>,
    we can guess that we're looping over colors,
    and sure enough,
    two lines down,
    we see <code>(color, color, color)</code>,
    which is creating a shade of gray defined by the current value of <code>color</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Backing up a line,
    we're creating a <code>SIZE</code>&times;<code>SIZE</code> image using <code>novice.new</code>
    and setting all its pixels to the fixed color <code>GRAY</code>.
    We're then&mdash;hm.
    What does <code>::SPACING</code> do?
    If it was <code>:SPACING</code> (with a single colon),
    it would mean,
    "From the start up to <code>SPACING</code>,"
    but there's a double colon there.
  </p>

  <p>
    The answer is that Python ranges can actually have three parts:
    the start,
    the end,
    and the <a href="glossary.html#stride">stride</a>,
    which is the separation between each entry.
    We can find out more about this inside the interpreter
    using the built-in <code>help</code> function:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">help(range)</span>
<span class="out">range(...)
    range([start,] stop[, step]) -> list of integers
    
    Return a list containing an arithmetic progression of integers.
    range(i, j) returns [i, i+1, i+2, ..., j-1]; start (!) defaults to 0.
    When step is given, it specifies the increment (or decrement).
    For example, range(4) returns [0, 1, 2, 3].  The end point is omitted!
    These are exactly the valid indices for a list of 4 elements.</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    However,
    that doesn't tell us that strides also work in indices:
    that's something we just have to know.
  </p>

  <p>
    So,
    going back to our program,
    the key lines are:
  </p>

<pre>
for color in range(BASE + STEP, BASE + NUMBER * STEP, STEP):
    ...create image...
    image[::SPACING, ::SPACING] = (color, color, color)
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The loop is going from <code>BASE + STEP</code> up to <code>BASE + NUMBER * STEP</code>
    in increments of <code>STEP</code>.
    <code>BASE</code> is 128&mdash;our initial shade of gray.
    <code>STEP</code> is 4:
    that's the increment each time we go around the loop.
    And <code>NUMBER</code> is how many we're doing,
    so this loop is creating a bunch of images with the same gray background,
    but whiter and whiter points spaced at equal intervals across them.

  <h2>Cutting Up Images</h2>

  <p>
    We now have everything we need to solve Valerie's original problem,
    which is to cut an image into pieces
    and colorize those pieces in different ways.
    First,
    let's figure out what our input file is,
    and how many pieces we want along the X and Y axes:
  </p>

<pre>
import sys
from skimage import novice

if len(sys.argv) != 4:
    print 'Expected source filename and number of tiles on X and Y'
    sys.exit(1)

original_filename = sys.argv[1]
tile_x = int(sys.argv[2])
tile_y = int(sys.argv[3])
</pre>

  <p>
    After importing our libraries,
    this program checks that it has the right number of arguments.
    (Once again,
    the number is 4 because <code>sys.argv[0]</code> is the name of the program.)
    If something is wrong,
    the program prints an error message and exits.
    <span class="fixme">explain why 1</span>
    It then stores the name of the source file in <code>original_filename</code>,
    and converts the other two arguments to integers.
  </p>

<pre>
original = novice.open(original_filename)
size_x = original.width / tile_x
size_y = original.height / tile_y
if (size_x == 0) or (size_y == 0):
    print 'Cannot create that many tiles.'
    sys.exit(1)
</pre>

  <p>
    Here,
    the program opens the source file
    and figures out how large each tile is going to be along the X and Y axes.
    Once again,
    it checks to make sure the answer is reasonable:
    if,
    for example,
    we ask for 2000 tiles along an axis that's 200 pixels large,
    the integer-over-integer division will set the size to zero,
    and we should exit right away.
  </p>

<pre>
for x in range(0, size_x * tile_x, size_x):
    for y in range(0, size_y * tile_y, size_y):
        tile = novice.new((size_x, size_y))
        tile[:, :] = original[x:x+size_x, y:y+size_y]
        tile_filename = str(x) + '-' + str(y) + '-' + original_filename
        tile.save(tile_filename)
</pre>

  <p>
    This nested loop creates our slices.
    The loop variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are coordinates of
    the lower-left corners of the slices;
    for each combination of their values,
    we create a new blank image
    (which we assign to <code>tile</code>),
    then copy over a section of the original image.
    We then construct a filename like
    <code>100-140-bicycle.jpg</code>
    and save that tile.
  </p>

</section>

<section id="s:cmdline">

  <p>
    Let's go back to our thumbnail creation program for a moment.
    It would be much more useful if we could create a thumbnail of any image we wanted
    without having to edit the program each time to change the name of the file.
    What we want is something like this:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls *.jpg</span>
<span class="out">mac.jpg</span>
$ <span class="in">python thumbnail mac.jpg</span>
$ <span class="in">ls *.jpg</span>
<span class="out">mac.jpg    thumb-mac.jpg</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    To make this work,
    we need a way to get filenames from the command line into our program.
    To do that,
    we need to use another library called <code>sys</code>
    (short for "system").
    It defines constants to tell us what version of Python we're using,
    what operating system we're running on,
    and so on:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">import sys</span>
<span class="in">print sys.version</span>
<span class="out">2.7 (r27:82525, Jul  4 2010, 09:01:59) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)]</span>
<span class="in">print sys.platform</span>
<span class="out">win32</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    The most commonly-used element of <code>sys</code>, though, is <code>sys.argv</code>,
    which holds the <a href="glossary.html#command-line-arguments">command-line arguments</a>
    used to run the program.
    These are accessed using indices,
    just like individual pixels;
    the biggest differences are that
    <code>sys.argv</code> is one-dimensional instead of two-dimensional,
    and that its values are strings rather than pixels.
    The name of the script itself is in <code>sys.argv[0]</code>;
    all the other arguments are put in <code>sys.argv[1]</code>, <code>sys.argv[2]</code>, and so on.
    For example, here's a program that does nothing except
    print its first three command-line arguments:
  </p>

<pre>
import sys
print 'location 0:', sys.argv[0]
print 'location 1:', sys.argv[1]
print 'location 2:', sys.argv[2]
</pre>

  <p>
    If we run save this code in a file called <code>three.py</code>,
    and run it like this:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">python three.py alpha beta</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    it prints:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="out">location 0: three.py
location 1: alpha
location 2: beta</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    However,
    if we run it with no arguments,
    or only one,
    we get this:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">python three.py</span>
<span class="out">location 0: /Users/gwilson/three.py
location 1:</span>
<span class="err">Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/gwilson/three.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    print 'location 1:', sys.argv[1]
IndexError: list index out of range</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    The problem is that <code>sys.argv[1]</code> doesn't exist,
    and Python won't let us read a value that isn't there.
    It's exactly like the undefined variables we encountered at the start of this chapter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's ignore that problem for now
    and go back to our thumbnail creator.
    Here's how we can make it work for an arbitrary file:
  </p>

<pre>
import sys
from skimage import novice

FIXED_WIDTH = 30

filename = sys.argv[1]
picture = novice.open(filename)
new_height = picture.height * fixed_width / picture.width
picture.height = new_height
picture.width = fixed_width
picture.save('thumb-' + filename)
</pre>

  <p>
    Let's walk through it piece by piece:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      We start by importing the libraries we need.
      <code>import</code> statements can actually be anywhere in the program,
      but it's considered good style to put them at the top,
      as it makes it easy for people to see what the program depends on.
    </li>
    <li>
      We give the fixed width we want thumbnails to have a name,
      so that we don't have to scatter the number 30 throughout the program.
      Values that are meant to be constants are usually written in UPPER CASE;
      again,
      it's not a requirement,
      but it's what most people do,
      so by sticking to this convention you will make it easier for other people to understand your code.
    </li>
    <li>
      The name of the image to be thumbnailed is supposed to be the program's single command-line argument,
      which means it will be in <code>sys.argv[1]</code>.
      (Remember, the program's name is in <code>sys.argv[0]</code>.)
      We could just use <code>sys.argv[1]</code> everywhere,
      but assigning the value to the variable <code>filename</code> makes our program easier to follow.
    </li>
    <li>
      We calculate the picture's new size
      and resize the picture as before.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally,
      we create the new filename by concatenating <code>'thumb-'</code> and the original filename,
      and save the thumbnail to that file.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <p>
    Let's take another look at the world's cutest child:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">from skimage import novice</span>
<span class="in">flower = novice.open('flower.jpg')</span>
<span class="in">flower.show()</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    What else can we do besides display this image?
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">print flower.format</span>
<span class="out">JPEG</span>
<span class="in">print flower.path</span>
<span class="out">/home/gvwilson/examples/flower.jpg</span>
<span class="in">print flower.height</span>
<span class="out">180</span>
<span class="in">print flower.width</span>
<span class="out">240</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    As this example shows,
    a picture object has <a href="glossary.html#property">properties</a>:
    its format (JPEG, PNG, and so on),
    the path to the file it was loaded from,
    and its height and width in pixels.
    Some of these are unchangeable,
    so that we can confuse our program
    by fooling it into thinking that a JPEG image is actually stored as a PNG,
    or that it was loaded from a different file than it actually was:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">flower.format = 'PNG'</span>
<span class="err">Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: can't set attribute</span>
<span class="in">flower.path = '/profiles/alan-turing.jpg'</span>
<span class="err">Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: can't set attribute</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    Others,
    however,
    are changeable.
    For example,
    we can squish the image by altering its height
    (<a href="#f:flower_squished">Figure XXX</a>).
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">flower.height = 90</span>
<span class="in">flower.show()</span>
</pre>

  <figure id="f:flower_squished">
    <img src="pymedia/flower_squished.jpg" alt="Squishing a Picture" />
  </figure>

  <p>
    We can now save this picture to a new file if we want:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">flower.save('squished.jpg')</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    When we do this,
    the object's <code>path</code> property is automatically updated
    to reflect its new location:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">print flower.path</span>
<span class="out">/home/gvwilson/examples/squished.jpg</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    And if we want to change its format,
    we can do that by saving it to a file with the appropriate suffix:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">flower.save('squished.<span class="highlight">png</span>')</span>
<span class="in">print flower.path</span>
<span class="out">/home/gvwilson/examples/squished.png</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    Now,
    suppose we want to create a thumbnail of a picture to put on a web page.
    We want the thumbnail to be exactly 30 pixels wide to fit into a table,
    and we want its height scaled proportionally.
    Here's what we could do:
  </p>

<pre>
from skimage import novice
picture = novice.open('mac.jpg')
new_height = picture.height * 30 / picture.width
picture.height = new_height
picture.width = 30
picture.save('thumb-mac.jpg')
</pre>

</section>

<section id="s:pixels">
  <h2>Manipulating Pixels</h2>

  <p>
    Changing the color of the entire image at once is useful for creating backgrounds,
    but most pictures have more detail than that.
    If we want to change the color of a single pixel,
    we need a way to refer to it.
    In Python and most other languages,
    we do that by providing an <a href="glossary.html#index">index</a>,
    which is just the coordinates of the pixel we want to access.
    To create a red image with a single white pixel in the lower-left corner,
    we would do this:
  </p>

<pre>
from skimage import novice
block = novice.new((10, 10), (255, 0, 0))
block[0, 0] = (255, 255, 255)
block.show()
</pre>

  <p>
    The first thing to notice about this example is that the lower-left corner is at (0, 0),
    not at (1, 1).
    Programming languages derived from C (which includes C++, Java, Python, Perl, and Ruby)
    count from 0:
    the first five indices into anything are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    Some other languages (notably Fortran, MATLAB, and R) count from 1.
    The latter is more sensible&mdash;nobody says, "Zero, one, two, three, four," when counting their fingers&mdash;but
    we're stuck with the former for programming.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second thing to notice about this example is that a 10&times;10 image is hard to see,
    and a single white pixel is almost invisible.
    Let's try this:
  </p>

<pre>
from skimage import novice
block = novice.new((10, 10), (255, 0, 0))
block[0, 0] = (255, 255, 255)
<span class="highlight">block.inflation = 10</span>
block.show()
</pre>

  <p>
    An image's <code>inflation</code> property tells the library how large to make each pixel
    when displaying or saving the image.
    This doesn't change how many pixels there actually are,
    or how they're indexed;
    it's purely a convenience to help us see what we're doing.
  </p>

  <p>
    What if we want to make the upper-right pixel white instead?
    We happen to know that our image is 10&times;10,
    so we could do this:
  </p>

<pre>
block[9, 9] = (255, 255, 255)
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The upper-right index is (9, 9) because we're counting from 0:
    if the image is ten pixels across,
    its X coordinates are 0..9.
    This works in this specific case,
    but it's a bad long-term solution:
    if someone changes the size of the image,
    the upper-right pixel probably won't be at (9, 9) any longer,
    and we don't want to have to check our program line-by-line to find things like this.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's one better solution:
  </p>

<pre>
block_width = 10
block_height = 10
block = novice.new((block_width, block_height), (255, 0, 0))
block[block_width - 1, block_height - 1] = (255, 255, 255)
</pre>

  <p>
    If someone changes the block's height or width now,
    the index expression in the last line will automatically adjust.
    This version of the program also makes the image's size a lot easier to find:
    instead of being buried inside a function call,
    <code>block</code>'s height and width are identified by name.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can improve this program even further like this:
  </p>

<pre>
block_width = 10
block_height = 10
<span class="highlight">red = (255, 0, 0)
white = (255, 255, 255)</span>
block = novice.new((block_width, block_height), <span class="highlight">red</span>)
block[block_width - 1, block_height - 1] = <span class="highlight">white</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    and then go one step further like this:
  </p>

<pre>
block_width = 10
block_height = 10
red = (255, 0, 0)
white = (255, 255, 255)
block = novice.new((block_width, block_height), red)
block[<span class="highlight">-1, -1</span>] = white
</pre>

  <p>
    Unlike most languages,
    Python is happy with negative indices:
    it uses them to count backward from the ends of things,
    rather than forward from the start
    (<a href="#f:negative_indices">Figure XXX</a>).
    Once you get used to it,
    it makes programs much easier to read&mdash;as the examples above show,
    the <code>-1</code> can be easy to miss when it's tacked onto the end of a long expression.
  </p>

  <figure id="f:negative_indices">
    <img src="pymedia/negative_indices.png" alt="Negative Indices" />
  </figure>

  <p>
    Now,
    what if we want to put a white border around our image?
    We could do this:
  </p>

<pre>
block[0, 0] = white
block[0, 1] = white
block[0, 2] = white
...
block[0, 9] = white
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    and then repeat it for the other three sides
    but that would be a lot of work to type in,
    we'd probably make mistakes along the way,
    and if the image size changes,
    we'll have to add or remove dozens or hundreds of lines.
    Here's a better way:
  </p>

<pre>
block[0, :]  = white
block[-1, :] = white
block[:, 0]  = white
block[:, -1] = white
</pre>

  <p>
    As you can probably guess,
    ':' on its own means "all indices"&mdash;it's a <a href="shell.html#pipefilter">wildcard</a>,
    just like '*' in filenames in the shell.
    Behind the scenes,
    the computer is still executing something like our original code&mdash;after all,
    each of the pixels on the border does need to be modified somehow&mdash;but:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      this code is much faster to write,
    </li>
    <li>
      much more likely to be correct,
      and
    </li>
    <li>
      once the computer knows it's supposed to update all the pixels in a row or column,
      it can probably do it faster than we could by hand.
    <li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    ':' on its own is actually a special case of something much more general
    called a <a href="glossary.html#slice">slice</a>.
    Let's modify the program like this:
  </p>

<pre>
from skimage import novice
block_width = 200
block_height = 200

    You can probably guess that the expression <code>0:40</code> refers to
    a range of pixels.
    What you might not guess is that the range goes from index 0 to index 39 inclusive,
    i.e.,
    from the lower limit up to, but not including, the upper limit.
    It may seem odd not to include the upper limit;
    the usual justifications are:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      When the ranges <code>lower:middle</code> and <code>middle:upper</code> are joined together,
      the pixel at coordinate <code>middle</code> is only included once.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the axis in question has <code>length</code> pixels,
      the expression <code>0:length</code> refers to each pixel exactly once.
    </li>
  </ol>

      <h3>Provenance Revisited</h3>

      <p>
        As we said near the end of <a href="svn.html#provenance">the previous chapter</a>,
        if we put a string like:
      </p>

<pre>
$Revision: ...$
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        in a file,
        Subversion can automatically update it
        each time we commit a change to that file.
        Let's add put <code>$Revision:$</code> in our program:
      </p>

<pre>
import sys
<span class="highlight">my_version = '$Revision: 143$'</span>
<span class="highlight">'Processed by check.py:', my_version</span>
have_seen_dashed_line = False
for line in data:
    if line.startswith('---'):
        have_seen_dashed_line = True
    elif have_seen_dashed_line:
        name, number, score = line.split()
        score = float(score)
        if (score &lt; 0.0) or (score &gt; 5.0):
            print 'Out of range:', name, number, score
<span class="out">Processed by check.py: $Revision: 143$
Out of range: range 2 7.5
Out of range: volume 1 -3.0</span>
</pre>

      <p>
        This is kind of handy:
        our output now automatically includes a description of who produced it&mdash;<em>exactly</em> who,
        i.e.,
        not just the name of the program,
        but also which version.
        To see why this is useful,
        let's rewrite the program so that it clips scores to lie inside 0&ndash;5
        instead of just reporting outlying values:
      </p>

<pre>
import sys
my_version = '$Revision: 143$'
'Processed by clip.py:', my_version
have_seen_dashed_line = False
for line in data:

    if have_seen_dashed_line:
        name, number, score = line.split()
        score = float(score)
        if score &lt; 0.0:
            print 0.0
        elif score &gt; 5.0:
            print 5.0
        else:
            print score

    else:
        print line.rstrip()
        if line.startswith('---'):
            have_seen_dashed_line = True
</pre>

      <div class="box">

        <h3>Ordering</h3>

        <p>
          Note that this version checked the <code>have_seen_dashed_line</code> flag first,
          then handles the case where the flag isn't yet true.
          Some people find this ordering easier to understand,
          because the "main" case that handles actual data comes first.
          Others prefer the original,
          arguing that the cases should appear in the order in which
          we expect the data to occur.
          It doesn't matter which we use,
          as long as we're consistent with our other loops.
        </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        When we run this program on the data that has invalid scores, it prints:
      </p>

        The three most important lines are highlighted.
        Two of them&mdash;the data lines&mdash;have been cleaned up;
        the line at the very top tells us who did the cleaning up.
        This is another step in our march toward having a real data provenance system:
        now,
        if we discover a bug in a program,
        we can look at our files and see which ones had been processed by that program.
        As we'll see in the <a href="funclib.html">next chapter</a>,
        we can extend this further to carry provenance information forward through an entire pipeline.

      <h3>Functions as Objects</h3>

      <p>
        An integer is just 32 or 64 bits of data that a variable can refer to,
        while a string is just a sequence of bytes that a variable can also refer to.
        Functions are just more bytes in memory&mdash;ones that happen to represent instructions.
        That means that variables can refer to them
        just as they can refer to any other data.
      </p>

      <p>
        This insight&mdash;the fact that code is just another kind of data,
        and can be manipulated like integers or strings&mdash;is
        one of the most useful and powerful in all computing.
        To understand why,
        let's have a closer look at what actually happens when we define a function:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/threshold.py">
def threshold(signal):
    return 1.0 / sum(signal)
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        These two lines tell Python that <code>threshold</code> is
        a function that returns one over the sum of the values in <code>signal</code>.
        When we define it,
        Python translates the statements in the function into a blob of bytes,
        then creates a variable called <code>threshold</code> and makes it point at that blob:
      </p>

      <figure id="f:defining_function">
        <img src="img/funclib/defining_function.png" alt="Defining a Function" />
      </figure>

      <p class="continue">
        This is not really any different from assigning the string <code>'alan turing'</code>
        to the variable <code>name</code>.
        the only difference is what's in the memory the variable points to.
      </p>

      <p>
        If <code>threshold</code> is just a reference to something in memory,
        we should be able to assign that reference to another variable.
        Sure enough,
        we can,
        and when we call the function via that newly-created alias,
        the result is exactly what we would get
        if we called the original function with the same parameters,
        because there's really only one function&mdash;it just has two names:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/threshold.py">
data = [0.1, 0.4, 0.2]
print threshold(data)
<span class="out">1.42857</span>
t = threshold
print t(data)
<span class="out">1.42857</span>
</pre>

      <figure id="f:aliasing_function">
        <img src="img/funclib/aliasing_function.png" alt="Aliasing a Function" />
      </figure>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>Aliasing and Importing</h3>

        <p>
          We have created aliases for functions before without realizing it.
          When we execute <code>from math import sqrt as square_root</code>,
          we are loading the <code>math</code> module,
          then creating an alias called <code>square_root</code>
          for its function <code>sqrt</code>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        If a function is just another kind of data,
        and we can create an alias for it,
        can we put it in a list?
        More precisely,
        can we put a reference to a function in a list?
        Let's define two functions,
        <code>area</code> and <code>circumference</code>,
        each of which takes a circle's radius as a parameter and returns the appropriate value:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/funclist.py">
def area(r):
    return pi * r * r

def circumference(r):
    return 2 * pi * r
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        Once those functions are defined, we can put them into a list
        (more precisely, put references to them in a list):
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/funclist.py">
funcs = [area, circumference]
</pre>

      <figure id="f:list_of_functions">
        <img src="img/funclib/list_of_functions.png" alt="A List of Functions" />
      </figure>

      <p>
        We can now loop through the functions in the list,
        calling each in turn.
        Sure enough,
        the output is what we would get if we called <code>area</code>
        and then <code>circumference</code>:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/funclist.py">
for f in funcs:
    print f(1.0)
<span class="out">3.14159
6.28318</span>
</pre>

      <p>
        Let's go a little further.
        Instead of storing a reference to a function in a list,
        let's pass that reference into another function,
        just as we would pass a reference to an integer, a string, or a list.
        Here's a function called <code>call_it</code> that takes two parameters:
        a reference to some other function, and some other value.
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/passfunc.py">
def call_it(func, value):
    return func(value)
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        All <code>call_it</code> does is call that other function with the given value as a parameter:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/passfunc.py">
print call_it(area, 1.0)
<span class="out">3.14159</span>

print call_it(circumference, 1.0)
<span class="out">6.28318</span>
</pre>

      <p>
        Now it's time for the payoff.
        Here's a function called <code>do_all</code>
        that applies a function&mdash;anything at all that takes one argument&mdash;to
        each value in a list,
        and returns a list of the results:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/doall.py">
def do_all(func, values):
    result = []
    for v in values:
        temp = func(v)
        result.append(temp)
    return result
</pre>

      <p>
        If we call <code>do_all</code> with <code>area</code> and a list of numbers,
        we get what we would get if we called <code>area</code> directly on each number in turn:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/doall.py">
print do_all(area, [1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
<span class="out">[3.14159, 12.56636, 28.27431]</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        And if we define a function to "slim down" strings of text
        by throwing away their first and last characters,
        we can apply it to every string in a list,
        without having to write another copy of the code that loops through the list,
        calls the function,
        and concatenates the results:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/doall.py">
def slim(text):
    return text[1:-1]

print do_all(slim, ['abc', 'defgh'])
<span class="out">b efg</span>
</pre>

      <p>
        Functions that operate on other functions are called
        <a href="glossary.html#higher-order-functions">higher-order functions</a>.
        They're common in mathematics:
        integration,
        for example,
        is a function that operates on some other function.
        In programming,
        higher-order functions allow us to mix and match pieces of code
        rather than duplicating them.
      </p>

      <p>
        As another example,
        let's look at <code>combine_values</code>,
        which takes a function and a list of values as parameters,
        and combines the values in the list using the function provided:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/combine.py">
def combine_values(func, values):
    current = values[0]
    for i in range(1, len(values)):
        current = func(current, values[i])
    return current
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        Now let's define <code>add</code> and <code>mul</code> to add and multiply values:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/combine.py">
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def mul(x, y):
    return x * y
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        If we combine 1, 3, and 5 with <code>add</code>, we get their sum, 9:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/combine.py">
print combine_values(add, [1, 3, 5])
<span class="out">9</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        If we combine the same values with <code>mul</code>, we get their product, 15:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/combine.py">
print combine_values(mul, [1, 3, 5])
<span class="out">15</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        This same higher-order function <code>combine_values</code> could concatenate lists of strings, too,
        or multiply several matrices together, or whatever else we wanted,
        without us having to write or test the loop ever again.
        Without higher-order functions,
        we would have to  write one function for each combination of data structure and operation,
        i.e.,
        one function to add numbers,
        another to concatenate strings,
        a third to sum matrices,
        and so on.
        <em>With</em> higher-order functions,
        on the other hand,
        we only write one function for each basic operation,
        and one function for each kind of data structure.
        Since A plus B is usually a lot smaller than A times B,
        this saves us coding, testing, reading, and debugging.
      </p>

      <p>
        Several higher-order functions are built in to Python.
        One is <code>filter</code>,
        which constructs a new list containing all the values in an original list
        for which some function is true:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/hof.py">
def positive(x):
    return x &gt; 0

print filter(positive, [-5, 3, -2, 9, 0])
<span class="out">[3, 9]</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        Another is <code>map</code>,
        which applies a function to every element of a list and returns a list of results:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/hof.py">
def bump(x):
    return x + 10

print map(bump, [-5, 3, -2, 9, 0])
<span class="out">[5, 13, 8, 19, 10]</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        And then there's <code>reduce</code>,
        which combines values using a binary function,
        returning a single value as a result:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/hof.py">
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

print reduce(add, [-5, 3, -2, 9, 0])
<span class="out">5</span>
</pre>

      <p>
        Combining all of these is a very powerful way to do a lot of computation
        with very little typing:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/hof.py">
print reduce(add, map(bump, filter(positive, [-5, 3, -2, 9, 0])))
<span class="out">32</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        Reading from the inside out, we have:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          filtered the list, keeping only the positive values,
        </li>
        <li>
          bumped them up by 10, and
        </li>
        <li>
          summed the results.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="continue">
        Written out, this is:
      </p>

<pre src="src/funclib/hof.py">
total = 0
for val in [-5, 3, -2, 9, 0]:
    if val &gt; 0:
        total += (val + 10)
print total
</pre>

      <p>
        The functional approach is usually more economical,
        and isn't too bad to read once calls are indented:
      </p>

<pre>
print reduce(add,
             map(bump,
             filter(positive,
                    [-5, 3, -2, 9, 0])))
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        However,
        the all-in-one-loop approach <em>is</em> faster,
        since each call in the functional approach is creating its own temporary list of results,
        only to have it discarded by the next function in the chain.
        As always,
        we should only worry about this once we are sure that
        (a) the program is working correctly,
        and (b) its performance really is a problem.

  <h2>Web Programming in Python</h2>
  
  <section id="s:web:reading">
    <h3>Reading Documents</h3>

    <p>
      People usually write their home pages by hand,
      but most pages that display lists of experimental results,
      or second-hand lab equipment for sale,
      are created by programs.
      For historical reasons,
      Python's standard library includes several libraries that process XML (including HTML);
      we'll use the simplest one,
      called <code>ElementTree</code>,
      but you will often run into programs that use others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of these libraries represent the nested structure of XML using something called
      the <a href="glossary.html#document-object-model">Document Object Model</a> (DOM).
      This stores the document as a <a href="glossary.html#tree">tree</a>
      with one node for each element or block of text.
      The root element of the document,
      such as the all-enclosing <code>html</code> in a web page,
      is the root node of the tree.
      Every other element or block of text is a child of it,
      or a child of a child,
      and so on.
      For example,
      the tree representing our web page about dimorphism
      looks like <a href="#f:dimorphism_tree">Figure XXX</a>.
    </p>

    <figure id="f:dimorphism_tree">
      <img src="img/web/dimorphism_tree.png" alt="Tree Representation of Dimorphism Page" />
      <figcaption>Tree Representation of Dimorphism Page</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      There are basically two ways to create a tree like this:
      parse a string (or file) containing XML,
      or build the nodes one by one and put them together manually.
      The former is more common,
      since the usual way to store and exchange XML or HTML is as text,
      so we will explore that first.
      Let's begin by turning text into HTML and then back into text:
    </p>

<pre src="src/web/parse_simple_page.py">
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

page = '''&lt;html&gt;

    &lt;p class="definition"&gt;Occurring or existing in two different &lt;u&gt;forms&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The most notable form is sexual dimorphism,
      in which males and females have noticeably different appearances.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;'''

      and giving it the alias <code>ET</code>
      (which is a lot easier to type and read).
      The multi-line string assigned to the variable <code>page</code>
      is the "document" we will parse;
      most real programs will read data from a file instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parsing itself takes just a single call to <code>ET.fromstring</code>;
      it returns the root node of the DOM tree corresponding to that document.
      We then convert that tree back to text by calling <code>ET.tostring</code>.
      The <code>'utf-8'</code> argument specifies how we want characters represented;
      you should always use this option unless you know enough to know
      that you want something else.

      The program's output is:
    </p>

<pre><span class="out">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Dimorphism&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p class="definition"&gt;Occurring or existing in two different &lt;u&gt;forms&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The most notable form is sexual dimorphism,
      in which males and females have noticeably different appearances.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      which is exactly what we started with.
    </p>

    <p class="fixme">point out how much simpler this is than parsing...</p>

    <p>
      In the example above,
      our output was exactly the same as our input,
      but that won't always be the case.
      Here's another simple program that converts text to a node tree and back:
    </p>

<pre src="src/web/round_trip.py">
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

original = '''&lt;root&gt;&lt;node
                     front="1"
                     back="2"&gt;content&lt;/node&gt;&lt;/root&gt;'''


doc = ET.fromstring(original)
print ET.tostring(doc, 'utf-8')
<span class="out">&lt;root&gt;&lt;node back="2" front="1"&gt;content&lt;/node&gt;&lt;/root&gt;</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      <code>node</code>'s attributes are all on one line in the output,
      and in a different order than they were in the input.
      The reason for the first difference is that XML ignores whitespace inside elements:
      the parser simply throws away
      the extra spaces and newlines inside the definition of <code>&lt;node&hellip;&gt;</code>.
      The reason for the second is that attributes are treated as a dictionary,
      and dictionary keys are unordered.
      As far as the rules of XML are concerned,
      the input and output are the same thing.
      Unfortunately,
      as far as string comparison and tools like <code>diff</code> are concerned,
      they are not.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since almost all XML or HTML documents are stored in files,
      the ElementTree library provides a convenience function
      that parses files directly.
      If <code>dimorphism.html</code> contains our definition of sexual dimorphism,
      then:
    </p>

<pre>
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
doc = ET.parse('dimorphism.html')
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      reads the text in that file,
      converts it to a DOM tree,
      and returns the tree's root node.

    <h3>Finding Nodes</h3>

    <p>
      Most databases are read more often than they're written,
      so most of <a href="db.html">our discussion of SQL</a>
      focuses on finding things.
      Most web pages are read more than once too,
      so libraries like ElementTree provide tools for locating nodes of interest.
      The most important of these is the <code>findall</code> method,
      which searches all the children of a node
      to find ones that match a pattern.
      For example,
      if some molecular formulas are stored like this:
    </p>

<pre src="src/web/molecular_formulas.xml">
&lt;formulas&gt;
  &lt;formula name="ammonia"&gt;
    &lt;atom symbol="N" number="1"/&gt;
    &lt;atom symbol="H" number="3"/&gt;
  &lt;/formula&gt;
  &lt;formula name="water"&gt;
    &lt;atom symbol="H" number="2"/&gt;
    &lt;atom symbol="O" number="1"/&gt;
  &lt;/formula&gt;
  &lt;formula name="methanol"&gt;
    &lt;atom symbol="C" number="1"/&gt;
    &lt;atom symbol="O" number="1"/&gt;
    &lt;atom symbol="H" number="4"/&gt;
  &lt;/formula&gt;
&lt;/formulas&gt;
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      then this program will count how many formulas there are:
    </p>

<pre src="src/web/count_formulas.py">
import sys
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

doc = ET.parse(sys.argv[1])
root = doc.getroot()
formulas = root.findall("./formula")
print len(formulas)
<span class="out">3</span>
</pre>

    <p>
      The key to this programs is <code>root.findall("./formula")</code>.
      The pattern <code>"./formula"</code> means,
      "Starting with this node ('.'),
      examine its children ('/')
      for elements with the tag 'formula."
      The result of the <code>findall</code> call is a list of nodes that match.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mini-language used for patterns is called
      <a href="glossary.html#xpath">XPath</a>.
      Some parts,
      like '.' and '/',
      are deliberately reminiscent of the way paths are described in
      <a href="shell.html#s:filedir">the Unix filesystem</a>.
      Other parts are more complicated,
      but it's possible to do a lot without using them.
      Some common XPath expressions are:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <code>tag</code>
        </td>
        <td>
          All immediate children with the given tag.
          <code>formula</code> selects all child <code>formula</code> elements,
          and <code>formula/atom</code> selects all <code>atom</code> elements
          that are children of <code>formula</code> children.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>
          All child elements.
          <code>*/atom</code> selects all grandchild <code>atom</code> elements,

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>//</td>

        <td>
          The current node.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>..</code></td>
        <td>The parent of the current node.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>[@attrib]</code></td>
        <td>
          All elements with the given attribute (regardless of that attribute's value).
          <code>.//atom[@name]</code> selects all atoms in the tree
          that have a <code>name</code> attribute,
          but not any <code>atom</code> elements that are missing that attribute.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <code>[@attrib="value"]</code>
        </td>
        <td>
          All elements for which the given attribute has the given value.
          <code>.//atom[@symbol="C"]</code> finds all carbon atoms.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <code>[tag]</code>
        </td>
        <td>
          All elements that have a child element with the given tag.
          <code>atom[comment]</code> finds all <code>atom</code> nodes
          that have an immediate child of type <code>comment</code>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <code>[position]</code>
        </td>
        <td>
          All elements that located in the given position relative to their parent.
          The position can be either an integer (1 is the first position),
          the expression <code>last()</code> for the last position,
          or a position relative to <code>last()</code>,
          such as <code>last()-1</code>.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Let's use these expressions to check that a data file is properly formatted
      by looking for all the <code>atom</code> nodes
      that are <em>not</em> immediate children of <code>formula</code> nodes.
      Our data file is:
    </p>

<pre src="src/web/bad_formulas.xml">
&lt;formulas&gt;
  &lt;formula name="ammonia"&gt;
    &lt;atom symbol="N" number="1"/&gt;
    &lt;atom symbol="H" number="3"/&gt;
  &lt;/formula&gt;
  &lt;atom symbol="H" number="2"/&gt;       <span class="comment">&lt;!-- mistake! --&gt;</span>
  &lt;formula name="water"&gt;
    &lt;atom symbol="O" number="1"&gt;
      &lt;atom symbol="H" number="2"/&gt;   <span class="comment">&lt;!-- another mistake --&gt;</span>
    &lt;/atom&gt;
  &lt;/formula&gt;
&lt;/formulas&gt;
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      and our program is:
    </p>

<pre src="src/web/validate_doc.py">
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

doc = ET.parse('bad_formulas.xml')
all_atoms = doc.findall('.//atom')
proper_atoms = doc.findall('.//formula/atom')
wrongly_placed = set(all_atoms) - set(proper_atoms)
for atom in wrongly_placed:
    print ET.tostring(atom)
<span class="out">&lt;atom number="2" symbol="H" /&gt;

&lt;atom number="2" symbol="H" /&gt;

</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      After converting the XML document to a tree,
      this program uses <code>doc.findall</code> to get all of the <code>atom</code> nodes,
      and then uses it again to find all the <code>atom</code> nodes
      that are immediate children of <code>formula</code> nodes.
      Subtracting the second set from the first
      gives the nodes that are <em>not</em> immediate children of <code>formula</code> nodes,
      i.e.,
      that are in the wrong place.
    </p>

    <p>
      A couple of things are worth pointing out about this program.
      First,
      the ElementTree library doesn't record where in the document nodes are from,
      so we can't pinpoint the line or character position of the offending nodes.
      Second,
      the double-spacing on the output comes from the fact that
      our original document contained lots of whitespace
      to make it easier for human beings to read,
      and ElementTree kept this whitespace
      (storing it as the <code>tail</code> value for various nodes).
      This kind of extra whitespace is always an annoyance when we're programming,
      so it's tempting to leave it out.
      However,
      doing so makes it harder for human beings to read the raw XML
      using line-oriented editors.
      Most modern browsers will display the XML as a tree
      (<a href="#f:xml_in_browser">Figure XXX</a>)
      but native XML-oriented editing tools are still clumsy.

  <section id="s:web:creating">
    <h3>Creating Documents</h3>

    <p>
      So much for reading XML: how do we create it?
      Let's start by writing a program that re-creates our dimorphism page
      one element at time:
    </p>

<pre src="src/web/build_simple_page.py">
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

root = ET.Element('html')

body = ET.Element('body')
root.append(body)

title = ET.SubElement(body, 'h1')
title.text = 'Dimorphism'

p1 = ET.SubElement(body, 'p')
p1.text = 'Occurring or existing in two different '
u = ET.SubElement(p1, 'u')
u.text = 'forms'
p1.tail = '.'

long_text = '''The most notable form is sexual dimorphism,
in which males and females have noticeably different appearances.'''
ET.SubElement(body, 'p').text = long_text

print ET.tostring(root)
</pre>

    <p>
      There is much less to this program than first appears.
      It starts by creating an object of type <code>Element</code>,
      which is the class the ElementTree library uses to represent nodes.
      The argument to <code>Element</code>'s constructor,
      <code>html</code>,
      specifies the element's type.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next two lines create another node of type <code>body</code>
      and then append that to the root node.
      At this point, our tree looks like
      <a href="#f:partial_tree">Figure XXX</a>:
    </p>

    <figure id="f:partial_tree">
      <img src="img/web/partial_tree.png" alt="Partially-Constructed Tree" />
      <figcaption>Partially-Constructed Tree</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The rest of the program does little more than create and append nodes.
      Because creating a node and appending it to another one is so common,
      ElementTree provides a convenience function called <code>SubElement</code>
      which combines the two steps.
      The two lines:
    </p>

<pre>
title = ET.SubElement(body, 'h1')
title.text = 'Dimorphism'
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      create a new node of type <code>h1</code>,
      append it to the <code>body</code> node,
      and then set the text content of the title node to be the string <code>'Dimorphism'</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next step is the most complicated.
      We need to create a paragraph node
      whose <code>class</code> attribute has the value <code>definition</code>,
      and which contains three things:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        the text <code>'Occurring or existing in two different&nbsp;'</code>
        (with a space at the end);
      </li>
      <li>
        a <code>u</code> element containing the text <code>'forms'</code>;
        and
      </li>
      <li>
        another piece of text containing the period '.' that ends the sentence.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Creating the paragraph node and appending it to our body node is easy:
      we just call <code>SubElement</code>.
      Setting an attribute is also easy:
      every node has a dictionary called <code>attrib</code>
      whose keys are attribute names
      and whose values are those attributes' values.
      The single line:
    </p>

<pre>
p1.attrib['class'] = 'definition'
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      therefore creates the attribute we want.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now for the paragraph's content.
      Again, the first part is easy:
      we just set <code>p1.text</code>.
      And underlining the word "forms" is easy too:
      we create a node of type <code>u</code> and append it to the paragraph.
      But where should the closing period be stored?
    </p>

    <p>
      Along with <code>text</code>,
      ElementTree nodes have another text field called <code>tail</code>,
      which stores the text <em>after</em> the node
      but before the start of anything else.
      Since the period is in the paragraph,
      the right place to store it is therefore <code>u.tail</code>
      (since putting it in <code>p1.tail</code> would imply that
      it came after the end of the first paragraph,
      but before the start of the next paragraph).
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally,
      we create the second paragraph that elaborates dimorphism's definition
      by combining node creation and text setting in a single line:
    </p>

<pre>
ET.SubElement(body, 'p').text = long_text
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      This works because <code>SubElement</code> returns the node it just created,
      so we can immediately set its <code>text</code> value.
    </p>

    <figure id="f:final_tree">
      <img src="img/web/final_tree.png" alt="Final Tree" />
      <figcaption>Final Tree</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      In memory,
      our document is now something like <a href="#f:final_tree">Figure XXX</a>.
      If we convert it to text,
      we get:
    </p>

<pre>
<span class="out">&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Dimorphism&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="definition"&gt;Occurring or existing in two&crarr;
different &lt;u&gt;forms&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most notable form is sexual dimorphism,
in which males and females have noticeably different appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      (As before, we use &crarr; to break a line that's too long to fit on the screen.)
      This has all the content we created,
      but <em>only</em> that content.
      We didn't create text nodes containing carriage returns and blanks,
      so <code>tostring</code> didn't insert them.
      Most machine-generated XML isn't nicely indented
      because computers don't care,
      but XML intended for human beings to read usually is.
    </p>

    <p>
      in practice,
      of course,
      programs usually wrap all these steps up in functions.
      For example,
      this function converts a Python list into an HTML ordered list:
    </p>

<pre src="src/web/list_to_ol.py">
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def convert(values):
    '''Convert a list of values to an &lt;ol&gt; list.'''

    result = ET.Element('ol')
    for v in values:
        ET.SubElement(result, 'li').text = str(v)
    return result

root = convert([1, "two", 3.4])
print ET.tostring(root)
<span class="out">&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;two&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3.4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
</pre>

    <p>
      The line:
    </p>

<pre>
        ET.SubElement(result, 'li').text = str(v)
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      does two things at once.
      First,
      it creates a new <code>li</code> (list element) node and returns it.
      Second,
      it sets the <code>text</code> of that node to be
      the string representation of the next list value.
      What it <em>doesn't</em> do is store a reference to that node in a separate variable.
      We could do this,
      as in:
    </p>

<pre>
    for v in values:
        node = ET.SubElement(result, 'li')
        node.text = str(v)
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      It's a matter of taste which is less unreadable,
      but since we're about to see a different approach that most people find better anyway,
      the question is moot.

    <p>
      Let's go back to sorting for a moment,
      and see if we can produce a list of scientists
      ordered by family name.
      We want our output to look like this:
    </p>

    <table class="outlined">
      <tr><td>Kovalevskaya, Sofia</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Lomonosov, Mikhail</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Mendeleev, Dmitri</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Pavlov, Ivan</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      This is easy to do in a programming language like Python:
      we just split the names on the space character,
      then join the two parts using a comma and a space.
    </p>

<pre>
result = []
for name in list_of_names:
    personal_name, family_name = name.split(' ')
    new_name = family_name + ', ' + personal_name
    result.append(new_name)
result.sort()
</pre>

    <p>
      We can do something like this in some dialects of SQL, but not all,
      and even when we can, it's harder to read.
      For example, if we're using Microsoft SQL Server, the query we need is:
    </p>

<pre>
SELECT SUBSTRING(Scientist, 1, CHARINDEX(Scientist, " ")-1)
       || ", "
       || SUBSTRING(Scientist, CHARINDEX(Scientist, " ")+1, LEN(Scientist))
       FROM Experiments;
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      Here,
      <code>CHARINDEX</code> and <code>SUBSTRING</code> are built-in functions
      that find the locations of characters and take substrings respectively,
      and <code>||</code> concatenates strings.
      This won't work as written with other databases,
      though,
      since their equivalents of <code>CHARINDEX</code> have different names
      (or, in the case of SQLite, may not exist at all).
      And even when it does work, it's still not a complete solution,
      since it doesn't sort the names.
    </p>

    <p>
      We could get further by using <a href="#s:nested">nested queries</a>,
      which we will discuss later in this chapter,
      but the right solution is to reformulate the problem.
      What we're trying to do is difficult because
      we have violated one of the fundamental rules of database design.
      The values in the <code>Scientist</code> field have several parts that we care about;
      in technical terms,
      they are not <a href="glossary.html#atomic-value">atomic values</a>.
      In a well-designed database,
      every value <em>is</em> atomic,
      so that it can be accessed directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's what our table looks like when we split names into their component parts:
    </p>

    <table class="outlined" src="db/create_single_table_experiments.sql">
      <tr><td colspan="4" align="center"><strong>Experiments</strong></td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>PersonalName</strong></td>
        <td><strong>FamilyName</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Project</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Hours</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sofia</td>
        <td>Kovalevskaya</td>
        <td>Antigravity</td>
        <td>6.5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sofia</td>
        <td>Kovalevskaya</td>
        <td>Teleportation</td>
        <td>11.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sofia</td>
        <td>Kovalevskaya</td>
        <td>Teleportation</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Mikhail</td>
        <td>Lomonosov</td>
        <td>Antigravity</td>
        <td>4.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mikhail</td>
        <td>Lomonosov</td>
        <td>Time Travel</td>
        <td>-2.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Dmitri</td>
        <td>Mendeleev</td>
        <td>Antigravity</td>
        <td>9.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ivan</td>
        <td>Pavlov</td>
        <td>Teleportation</td>
        <td>9.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ivan</td>
        <td>Pavlov</td>
        <td>Time Travel</td>
        <td>-7.0</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="continue">
      It looks like a small change, but it has major implications.
      First, it makes the SQL simpler,
      since we no longer have to do substring operations to get values:
    </p>

<pre make="select-distinct-names">
SELECT DISTINCT FamilyName || ", " || PersonalName FROM Experiments;
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      Second,
      this SQL will be much more efficient,
      since repeatedly finding substrings takes more time than simply matching values directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our redesigned table still violates an important rule of database design.
      To see how,
      let's look at what happens if we want to store people's email addresses:
    </p>

    <table class="outlined" src="db/create_single_table_experiments.sql">
      <tr><td colspan="5" align="center"><strong>Experiments</strong></td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>PersonalName</strong></td>
        <td><strong>FamilyName</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Email</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Project</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Hours</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sofia</td>
        <td>Kovalevskaya</td>
        <td>skol@euphoric.edu</td>
        <td>Antigravity</td>
        <td>6.5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sofia</td>
        <td>Kovalevskaya</td>
        <td>skol@euphoric.edu</td>
        <td>Teleportation</td>
        <td>11.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sofia</td>
        <td>Kovalevskaya</td>
        <td>skol@euphoric.edu</td>
        <td>Teleportation</td>
        <td>5.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mikhail</td>
        <td>Lomonosov</td>
        <td>mikki@freesci.org</td>
        <td>Antigravity</td>
        <td>4.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mikhail</td>
        <td>Lomonosov</td>
        <td>mikki@freesci.org</td>
        <td>Time Travel</td>
        <td>-2.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Dmitri</td>
        <td>Mendeleev</td>
        <td>mendeleev@euphoric.edu</td>
        <td>Antigravity</td>
        <td>9.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ivan</td>
        <td>Pavlov</td>
        <td>pablum@euphoric.edu</td>
        <td>Teleportation</td>
        <td>9.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ivan</td>
        <td>Pavlov</td>
        <td>pablum@euphoric.edu</td>
        <td>Time Travel</td>
        <td>-7.0</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      There's a lot of redundancy in this table:
      every time "Sofia" appears as a personal name,
      the family name is always "Kovalevskaya",
      and the email address is always "skol@euphoric.edu".
      If we use this design,
      we will have to eliminate duplicates almost every time we run a query,
      and if Sofia changes her email address,
      we will have to update several rows of the database.
    </p>

    <p>
      The right way to store this data is
      to separate information about scientists
      from information about experiments,
      so that no fact is ever duplicated.
      We can do this by splitting our table in two:
    </p>

    <table class="outlined">
      <tr><td colspan="3" align="center"><strong>Experiments</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>5.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-2.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>dmen</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>9.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ipav</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>9.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ipav</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-7.0</td></tr>
    </table>

    <table class="outlined">
      <tr><td colspan="4" align="center"><strong>Scientists</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Kovalevskaya</td><td>Sofia</td><td>skol@euphoric.edu</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>Lomonosov</td><td>Mikhail</td><td>mikki@freesci.org</td></tr>
      <tr><td>dmen</td><td>Mendeleev</td><td>Dmitri</td><td>mendeleev@euphoric.edu</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ipav</td><td>Pavlov</td><td>Ivan</td><td>pablum@euphoric.edu</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Facts about our scientists now appear exactly once,
      as do the entries for experiments.
      The only exception is the two entries for Sofia Kovalevskaya's hours on the Teleportation project,
      which was in the original data.
      At this point,
      we should either insist that
      all the hours each scientist has spent on a particular project appear in a single database entry,
      or document the reasons for having multiple entries
      (e.g., because each entry is the hours worked in a single week or month).

    <h3>Self Join</h3>

    <p>
      One special case of joining tables comes up so often that it has its own name:
      <a href="glossary.html#self-join">self join</a>.
      As the name suggests,
      this means joining a table with itself.
      To see why this is useful,
      let's try to find out how many scientists have worked on two or more projects.
      Our first guess looks like this:
    </p>

<pre src="src/db/self_join_incorrect.sql">
SELECT PersonID, COUNT(*) FROM Experiments GROUP BY PersonID WHERE COUNT(*) > 1;
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      but that's not legal SQL&mdash;we can't use
      an aggregated value in our <code>WHERE</code> clause,
      because <code>WHERE</code> is applied row-by-row before aggregation happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, let's join the <code>Experiments</code> table to itself.
      We will give each copy of the table an alias,
      so that we can tell which values came from which copy:
    </p>

<pre src="src/db/self_join_all.sql">
SELECT * FROM Experiments a JOIN Experiments b;
</pre>

    <p>
      The result has 64 rows, a few of which are shown below:
    </p>

    <table class="outlined">
      <tr>
        <td><strong>a.PersonID</strong></td>
        <td><strong>a.Project</strong></td>
        <td><strong>a.Hours</strong></td>
        <td><strong>b.PersonID</strong></td>
        <td><strong>b.Project</strong></td>
        <td><strong>b.Hours</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>5.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>mlom</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>mlom</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-2.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>dmen</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>9.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>ipav</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>9.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>ipav</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-7.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="center">&hellip;</td><td align="center">&hellip;</td><td align="center">&hellip;</td><td align="center">&hellip;</td><td align="center">&hellip;</td><td align="center">&hellip;</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>4.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>4.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td align="center">&hellip;</td><td align="center">&hellip;</td><td align="center">&hellip;</td><td align="center">&hellip;</td><td align="center">&hellip;</td><td align="center">&hellip;</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Now let's add a <code>WHERE</code> clause to filter out rows
      that have different <code>PersonID</code> values,
      i.e.,
      where we have joined information about one person with information about another:
    </p>

<pre src="src/db/self_join_personid.sql">
SELECT * FROM Experiments a JOIN Experiments b WHERE a.PersonID = b.PersonID;
</pre>

    <table class="outlined">
      <tr>
        <td><strong>a.PersonID</strong></td>
        <td><strong>a.Project</strong></td>
        <td><strong>a.Hours</strong></td>
        <td><strong>b.PersonID</strong></td>
        <td><strong>b.Project</strong></td>
        <td><strong>b.Hours</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>5.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>5.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>5.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>5.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>5.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>5.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>4.0</td><td>mlom</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>4.0</td><td>mlom</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-2.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-2.0</td><td>mlom</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-2.0</td><td>mlom</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-2.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>dmen</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>9.0</td><td>dmen</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>9.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ipav</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>9.0</td><td>ipav</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>9.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ipav</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>9.0</td><td>ipav</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-7.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ipav</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-7.0</td><td>ipav</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>9.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ipav</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-7.0</td><td>ipav</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-7.0</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Now let's add another clause to our <code>WHERE</code>
      to get rid of records where the two project names are the same:
    </p>

<pre src="src/db/self_join_project.sql">
SELECT * FROM Experiments a JOIN Experiments b
WHERE (a.PersonID = b.PersonID) AND (a.Project != b.Project);
</pre>

    <table class="outlined">
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>5.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>11.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>5.0</td><td>skol</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>6.5</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>4.0</td><td>mlom</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-2.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-2.0</td><td>mlom</td><td>Antigravity</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ipav</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>9.0</td><td>ipav</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-7.0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ipav</td><td>Time Travel</td><td>-7.0</td><td>ipav</td><td>Teleportation</td><td>9.0</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      This may not seem like progress,
      but we have almost answered our original question.
      Each of these records represents the fact that some person has worked on two different projects.
      Putting it another way,
      if someone has only ever worked on one project (or hasn't worked on any projects at all),
      their ID will not appear in any record in this set.
      To get the list of names of people who have worked on two or more projects,
      therefore,
      all we have to do is display either <code>a.PersonID</code> or <code>b.PersonID</code>
      (and eliminate duplicates using <code>DISTINCT</code>).
      We will split our final query across several lines to make it easier to read,
      and use an <code>ORDER BY</code> to ensure that our results are sorted:
    </p>

<pre src="src/db/self_join_final.sql">
SELECT DISTINCT a.PersonID
FROM            Experiments a JOIN Experiments b
WHERE           (a.PersonID = b.PersonID) AND (a.Project != b.Project)
ORDER BY        a.PersonID ASC;
</pre>

    <table class="outlined">
      <tr>
        <td>ipav</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>mlom</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>skol</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      If you hang around programmers long enough,
      you will eventually hear someone call this trick "intuitive".
      They are using that word the way certain mathematicians use "obvious":
      it means,
      "You only have to read the proof a couple of times to get it."
      There actually is a rich mathematical theory underneath SQL,
      and if you immerse yourself in that theory,
      tricks like joining a table to itself do eventually seem obvious.
      For the rest of us, though,
      it's enough to learn this pattern
      and recognize when it should be used.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="s:db:nested">
    <h3>Nested Queries</h3>

    <p>
      Let's switch back to the <code>Experiments</code> table that doesn't contain <code>NULL</code>s.
      How do we find scientists who have <em>not</em> been working on time travel?
      Our first guess might be:
    </p>

<pre src="src/db/select_not_time_travel_flawed.sql">
SELECT DISTINCT PersonID FROM Experiments WHERE Project != "Time Travel";
</pre>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, this doesn't give us what we want.
      <code>ivan</code> and <code>skol</code> have both worked both on Time Travel,
      but show up in the results:
    </p>

    <table class="outlined">
      <tr><td>dmen</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ipav</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Let's think this through.
      There are scientists who have worked on Time Travel,
      scientists who have only worked on other projects,
      and scientists who have done both.
      Our query returns all of the scientists who have worked on projects other than Time Travel,
      but that includes ones who have worked on Time Travel <em>and</em> other projects
      (<a href="#f:venn_time_travel">Figure XXX</a>).
    </p>

    <figure id="f:venn_time_travel">
      <img src="img/db/venn_time_travel.png" alt="Scientists and Time Travel" />
      <figcaption>Scientists and Time Travel</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The trick to answering this question&mdash;and it <em>is</em> a trick&mdash;is
      to subtract those scientists who <em>have</em> worked on Time Travel
      (i.e., the ones we <em>don't</em> want)
      from the set of all scientists.
      To do this,
      we will need to use a <a href="glossary.html#nested-query">nested query</a>
      (also called a <a href="glossary.html#subquery">subquery</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's work up to it in stages.
      Finding all of the scientists is easy:
    </p>

<pre>
SELECT DISTINCT PersonID FROM Experiments;
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      If we knew in advance which scientists we didn't want,
      we could use <code>NOT IN</code> to subtract a fixed set,
      like this:
    </p>

<pre>
SELECT DISTINCT PersonID FROM Experiment WHERE PersonID NOT IN ('ivan', 'skol');
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      We don't actually know which scientists who have worked on Time Travel,
      but we can generate it with this query:
    </p>

<pre src="src/db/time_travel_subquery.sql">
SELECT DISTINCT PersonID FROM Experiment WHERE Project = "Time Travel";
</pre>

    <p>
      What we want to do is somehow use the result of the second query in the first.
      SQL allows us to do exactly this,
      i.e.,
      to nest one query inside another so that we can use the results of the nested query
      in the filter conditions of the main query.
      Here's what it looks like:
    </p>

<pre src="src/db/select_nested_subtract.sql">
SELECT DISTINCT PersonID FROM Experiments WHERE PersonID NOT IN
       (SELECT DISTINCT PersonID FROM Experiments WHERE Project = "Time Travel");
</pre>

<table class="outlined">
  <tr><td>dmen</td></tr>
  <tr><td>skol</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>
      We can read this query as saying,
      "Fetch all of the scientists who have done experiments,
      except for the ones that appear in the list of scientists who have worked on Time Travel".
      It isn't intuitive,
      but the pattern is easy to learn,
      and very useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nested queries can also be used as if they were tables in their own right.
      For example,
      suppose we want to know how many different projects each scientist has worked on.
      We can begin by finding the distinct list of projects for scientist like this:
    </p>

<pre>
SELECT DISTINCT PersonID, Project FROM Experiments;
</pre>

    <p>
      Now we want to count how many results there are for each scientist.
      Since counting is an aggregation,
      we need to use the results of this query as input for another query that does the aggregation.
      We can do this by wrapping the first query in parentheses
      and putting it in the <code>FROM</code> clause of the second query:
    </p>

<pre>
&hellip;
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT PersonID, Project FROM Experiments);
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      The next step is to write the outer query.
      We want the scientist, and count of their projects:
    </p>

<pre>
SELECT PersonID, COUNT(*)
FROM   (SELECT DISTINCT PersonID, Project FROM Experiments);
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      and since we want the count for each scientists,
      we have to add a <code>GROUP&nbsp;BY</code> for the outer query.
      The whole thing is therefore:
    </p>

<pre src="src/db/nested_query_group_by.sql">
SELECT   PersonID, COUNT(*)
FROM     (SELECT DISTINCT PersonID, Project FROM Experiments)
GROUP BY PersonID;
</pre>

    <table class="outlined">
      <tr><td>dmen</td><td>1</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ipav</td><td>2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mlom</td><td>2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>skol</td><td>2</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Nesting queries like this is really useful
      if the data we want isn't present in exactly the right form in the database.
      We can use one query to get the data in the form we need it in,
      and then wrap another query around it to get the answer we originally wanted.
